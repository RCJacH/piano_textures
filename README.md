# PIANO TEXTURES

## WHAT IS THIS

This repo is a collection of piano accompaniment textures found in classical or other genres of music, designed to be a pool of inspiration to ~steal~ learn from, written in [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) language.

## WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR

There are really very little textures that are involved in the pop, rock, or even jazz context in terms of piano playing.
Most of the materials involves either block chords, arpeggios, chorale lines, rhythms, or chords + melody with occational doublings.
Thus incorporating other textures from time to time can be helpful to sustain interest.

## HOW SHOULD I USE IT

The data is organized by genre, composer, opus - piece, then movement.

The first page is the motives, a list of basic textures and variations used in the piece, as a C major chord.
The rest consists of combinations of different textures/variations found within the piece.
However, since this is not music analysis, not all contents are covered, some motives or variations might be left out to simply and shorten the result.
